- ✅ Asked clarifying questions about field creation
- ✅ Updated package.json name to "jsonl-explorer"
- ✅ Created Convex schema for datasets and records
- ✅ Built file upload component with JSONL parsing
- ✅ Created field selection interface
- ✅ Implemented data table with column configuration
- ✅ Updated routing and removed demo content
- ✅ Tested implementation with Playwright
- ✅ Fixed import paths and linting issues
- ✅ All features working correctly

## Commits Made During Session
- 8609f73: init: setup JSONL explorer app with updated package name and removed template instructions
- cc3249d: feat: implement JSONL explorer with file upload, field selection, and data table
- e493b7e: style: implement tighter spacing and higher information density
- 9b65b39: feat: improve cell content display and expansion

## Implementation Details
- **Schema**: datasets table with field tracking, records table with JSON data
- **Components**: FileUpload (JSONL parsing), FieldSelector (dropdown), DataTable (responsive)
- **Routes**: Home page with dataset list, dataset detail page with table view
- **Features**: File upload, field selection, data visualization, responsive design
- **Testing**: Responsive design tested, console clean, linting passed

## Ready for Use
JSONL Explorer with advanced table features is complete and functional. Users can:
1. Sign in with Clerk authentication
2. Upload JSONL files with automatic parsing
3. Select which top-level fields to display as table columns
4. **NEW**: Create custom fields using JSONPath expressions for nested/array data
5. **NEW**: Resize columns by dragging the column borders
6. **NEW**: Hide/show columns using the "Columns" button
7. **NEW**: Expand cells to view full content in a modal
8. View data in a responsive table format with both regular and custom fields
9. Navigate between datasets

## Advanced Table Features
- **Column Resizing**: Drag column borders to resize widths (minimum 80px)
- **Column Visibility**: Toggle column visibility with checkboxes in the settings panel
- **Row Expansion**: Click rows or expand button to view all fields with full content in place
- **CSS-Based Truncation**: Text truncation responds to actual column width
- **Responsive Design**: Table scrolls horizontally on smaller screens, expanded rows use responsive grid
- **State Management**: Column widths and visibility persist during the session

## JSONPath Feature Details
- **Custom Field Editor**: Add JSONPath expressions like `$.items[0].name` or `$.user.profile.email`
- **Validation**: Backend validates JSONPath syntax and prevents duplicates
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid expressions
- **Data Extraction**: Uses jsonpath-plus library for reliable data extraction
- **Visual Indicators**: Custom fields show JSONPath expression in table headers
- **Type Support**: Optional type hints (string, number, boolean, array, object)

## Information Density Improvements
- **Collapsible Custom Fields**: Custom JSONPath Fields section now collapses by default with toggle
- **Tighter Table Spacing**: Reduced padding, smaller text (table-xs), narrower default columns (150px)
- **Compact Forms**: Reduced gaps and padding in all form components and cards
- **CSS-Based Truncation**: Text truncation now responds to actual column width instead of fixed character count
- **Responsive Column Resizing**: Minimum width reduced to 80px for very compact columns

## Enhanced Content Display
- **In-Place Row Expansion**: Replaced modal with in-place row expansion for better workflow
- **Full Field Visibility**: Expanded rows show all fields with complete content and metadata
- **Responsive Expanded Layout**: Uses grid layout that adapts to screen size
- **JSONPath Indicators**: Shows JSONPath expressions and field types in expanded view
- **Scrollable Content**: Long content is contained in scrollable areas within expanded view
